<p>A Node.js library for testing web applications using WebDriver and ARIA</p>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria/">WAI-ARIA</a> and
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/">WebDriver</a> are two distinct web standards
with highly similar goals: they both aim to enable machine-mediated interaction
with web pages. In the case of ARIA, the machine is some Assistive Technology
(e.g. a screen reader or a braille display), and it enables a person with a
disability to effectively browse the web. In the case of WebDriver, the machine
is a script written by a web developer, and it enables the developer to verify
the correctness of their work.</p>
<pre><code>                                             .--------------.
                                             | Application  |
                                             +----------.   |
Developer --&gt; page objects ---&gt; WebDriver --&gt;| HTML     |   |
                                             +------.   |   |
User ---------&gt; Asssive Technology ---------&gt;| ARIA |   |   |
                                             '------+---+---'
</code></pre>
<p>The differences in the paths used by developers and users to access web
applications cause a number of problems. Web developers have little
insight into the correctness of their application from the perspective
of a visitor using Assistive Technology. Instead, they typically build a
separate layer to facilitate testing, comprised of so-called <a href="http://elementalselenium.com/tips/7-use-a-page-object">&quot;page
objects&quot;</a>. This
layer commonly circumvents the patterns used by Assistive Technology.
Maintaining it is a drain on their time and attention, and it only
indirectly benefits the people who use the application (i.e. by enabling
a limited form of testing).</p>
<p>The goal of the AriaDriver project is to converge the paths that developers and
users take to reach web applications. By giving developers a more wholistic
view into their own applications, AriaDriver can help web authors create more
accessible applications. By implementing <a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/">accessible user interface
patterns</a>, AriaDriver can also reduce
the need for custom testing logic and improve test stability.</p>
<pre><code>                                             .--------------.
                                             | Application  |
                                             +----------.   |
Developer -------&gt; AriaDriver -------.       | HTML     |   |
                                      \      +------.   |   |
User ---------&gt; Asssive Technology ---------&gt;| ARIA |   |   |
                                             '------+---+---'
</code></pre>
<h2>Standardization</h2>
<p>Although a Node.js library such as this may be useful for some developers, its
benefits could be magnified through standardization. If the API offered by this
library were instead defined as &quot;commands&quot; in the W3C WebDriver specification,
then:</p>
<ul>
<li>future enhancements could be wholistically designed by the experts who
contribute to the relevant standards, that is: <a href="https://www.w3.org/testing/browser/">the Browser Testing and Tools
Working Group</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">the Web
Accessibility Initiative</a></li>
<li>the practice of accessibility-driven testing would be recognized by more
developers and (thanks to the language-agnostic design of the WebDriver
protocol) usable from more projects</li>
<li>operations would be more efficient because fewer instructions would have to
be sent &quot;over the wire&quot; of the WebDriver protocol</li>
</ul>
